# Gomoku
This repository is a Python implementation of the abstract strategy board game Gomoku.

The program allows the game Gomoku to be played between two human users running the program. The board in the game is a square grid (default 15 x 15) with valid spots to put black and white pieces. It is updated and displayed after each turn. Each player takes turns placing a piece on valid places on the board when prompted. If an error is displayed when adding a piece, the user must try again until a valid move is made. The winner of the game is the first player to get 5 pieces in a row, whether that be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game is terminated if at any point a player inputs 'q'.
